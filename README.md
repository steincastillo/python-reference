## Python Quick Reference  

This is the reference guide to Python that I **wish** had existed when I was learning the language.

Here's what I want in a reference guide:

- **High-quality examples** that show the simplest possible usage of a given feature
- **Explanatory comments**, and descriptive variable names that eliminate the need for some comments
- Presented as a **single script**, so that I can keep it open and search it when needed
- **Code that can be run** from top to bottom, with the relevant objects defined nearby

This is **not** written as a full-fledged Python tutorial, though the topics are ordered in a way that you can read it like a tutorial (i.e., each topic depends only on material preceding it).

The guide was written using Python 3.

### Other Python Resources

If you like the general format of this guide, but need **more explanation of each topic**, I highly recommend reading the Appendix of [Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do). It presents the essentials of the Python language in a clear and focused manner.

If you are looking for a resource that will help you to **learn Python from scratch**, this is [my list of recommended resources](https://github.com/justmarkham/DAT8#python-resources).

### Suggestions or Corrections

If there's a **topic or example** you'd like me to add to this guide, or you notice a **mistake**, please [create a GitHub issue](../../issues).

Thank you!
